### 2.1 Context and Motivation
<a name="sp2.2"></a>
In computer science (in particular in Artificial Intelligence), model checking is a method for checking whether a finite-state model of a system meets a given specification. In model checking given a system model and a formal property the model chercker checks if the model satisfy the property. NuSMV is one of the most used model checker and it takes in input a finite state machine in a language called SMV and a formal property written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), or Computational Tree Logic. The model written in SMV usually define a Kripke Structure a type of Finite State Machine. However one of the most used languages for defining Reactive Systems are the Mealy Machines. So in order to use NuSMV to model check a mealy machine against some LTL property we need to translate the mealy machine into a a SMV file.

### 2.2 Project Obectives 
<a name="p3"></a>
Goal of the project is to develop a translator from a mealy machine to a kripke structure in SMV format.
