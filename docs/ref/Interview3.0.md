1. **Q1**: What is a MM? 
2. **A1**: A Mealy machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined both by its current state and the current inputs.
3. **Q2**: How is the format of a file describing a Mealy Machine? Do you have one?
4. **A2**: Well, yes I gave you an example of it and you can find an example file in the references that I gave you. See for example the file 
[MM1](MM1.png) or the one to the [MM2](https://easyexamnotes.com/p/mealy-machine.html)
6. **Q3**: What does a MM represent?
7. **A3**: Usually represent a reactive system.
8. **Q4**: What is a reactive system?
9. **A4**: Reactive systems have an ongoing interaction with their environment. MM is a formalism to model Finite State Reactive Systems. For example Hardware system, Concurrent and Distribuited Algorithm.... 
10. **Q5**: What is a SMV file?
11. **A5**: SMV stands for Symbolic Model Verifier, and it is a language that helps to model a Finite State Reactive System. You can find more infomation to the home page of [NuSMV](https://nusmv.fbk.eu/NuSMV/userman/v11/html/nusmv_2.html)
12. **Q6**: Do you have any example? 
13. **A6**: You can fine more information in the link above.
14. **Q7**: Do you need a GUI to depict the MM?
15. **A7**: Well, not at the beginning. This could be a thing that can be added later on.
16. **Q8**: Which kind of applications would you like me to develop? Desktop? Web based? App?
17. **A8**: At the begininng a desktop application should be fine
18. **Q9**: Which OS?
19. **A9**: Flexible. We prefer Linux based, then Windows and may be MacOS. Eventually a web based application could be a good thing, don'you think?
20. **Q10**: Would you like also a GUI for the SMV file? Which are the functionality of the GUI? 
21. **A10**: NO!
22. **Q11**: Does the application need to interact with a database? Does there exists one?
23. **A11**: We don't need one and, no we don't have one.
